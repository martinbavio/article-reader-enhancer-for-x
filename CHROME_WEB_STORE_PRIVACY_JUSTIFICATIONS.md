# Chrome Web Store Privacy Practices - Required Information

## 1. Host Permission Justification

**Question:** Why does your extension need host permissions?

**Answer:**
```
This extension requires host permissions for twitter.com and x.com to inject CSS and JavaScript that enhances the visual presentation of article content. The extension applies typography improvements, hides distracting UI elements, and displays a reading progress indicator. No data is collected, stored, or transmitted - all enhancements are applied locally in the browser.
```

## 2. Remote Code Justification

**Question:** Does your extension use remote code?

**Answer:**
```
No, this extension does NOT use remote code. All code is bundled locally within the extension package.

Note: The extension loads Google Fonts (Libre Baskerville) from fonts.googleapis.com for typography enhancement, but this is a standard font loading practice and does not involve executing remote code. If asked specifically about this, you can mention:

"The extension loads the Libre Baskerville font from Google Fonts CDN for typography enhancement. This is a standard web font loading practice and does not execute any remote code. All extension logic is contained within the packaged files."
```

**If the form requires this field anyway:**
```
This extension does not execute any remote code. It loads web fonts from Google Fonts CDN (fonts.googleapis.com) for typography purposes only, which is a standard practice for displaying custom fonts. All extension logic and functionality is contained within the packaged extension files.
```

## 3. Single Purpose Description

**Question:** What is the single purpose of your extension?

**Answer:**
```
Enhance the reading experience of articles on X (formerly Twitter) by improving typography, layout, and removing distractions.
```

**Alternative (more detailed):**
```
Transform X's native article reader into a distraction-free reading experience with enhanced typography, optimized layout, and a reading progress indicator.
```

- **No External APIs:** Your extension doesn't call any external APIs or services (besides Google Fonts for fonts).
